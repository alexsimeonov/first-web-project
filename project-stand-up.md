# **Team 1 Standup**

### Web Team Project

- Things we did well:

  > - The preparation before starting the project was good.
  > - We separated our tasks well.
  > - We managed to finish the asigned tasks in time and there is enough time to prepare for the presentation.

* Things we had difficulties with:

  > - We didn't add comments to the code while writing it and had to do it after finishing the tasks.

* Things we can improve:

  > - We could improve our communication. For example letting the other teammates know if we made any improvement that could be useful for them too.
